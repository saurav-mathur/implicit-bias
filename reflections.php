           Paired Programming: Although I have taken several computer sciences courses here at Madison which involved a significant amount of group work, this was the first time I participated in a paired programming session while not being in the same room as my partner. The overall idea remained the same – one of us would actually type in the code while the other would guide them and review the code typed, switching between the roles regularly. We used Microsoft Teams to achieve this because it has a great screen sharing feature which even has the ability to control someone else’s computer via the Teams call. Overall, I would say the experience was comparable to that of doing so in person, even having the added benefit of the two of us not having to compete for screen real estate allowing for a better workflow.
           </p>
           <p>
Project Work: Since this course was the first time I worked with PHP and SQL, it was a bit daunting at first – I initially had no idea of how to even start the project. Then I decided to work through the assignments for the course itself and realized that the assignments had slowly been building up my knowledge of different aspects of web development – Assignment 2 taught me how to build a website with HTML and CSS, and the next two taught me about PHP and SQL. Our team then decided to use the Assignment 4 as a starting point to make a skeleton survey. After the skeleton was ready, we divided up the work – one team work on the content and the other team would make the website – I mainly worked on developing the website, adding and/or creating pages as needed, making iterative changes to see what worked and what didn’t and ending up with a truly unique aesthetic to our site. I also created helpec creat ethe content on the homepage, the results page, and the resources page.</p>
<p>
Once we had submitted the first draft, we received feedback from our peers as well as from the instructors. The feedback was mostly positive with two specific points we were told we could improve on:<br>
1.	A question which talked about preferring a medical professional or lawyer of the same race.<br>
2.	We did not have enough content that explained what our test was about<br>
<p>We decided to keep the question in point 1 as we felt that even though the questions might be drastically different from the perspective of a POC vs a non-POC, it still allowed one to gain an insight on their view of race. As for the second point, we added more content to the homepage which explains what our test is about and added media that would allow the test taker to learn more about the reasoning behind the test.</p>
<p>
LIS 500: As for the course, I felt that I learnt a lot, (and have many more questions) than I did before taking this course. At the start of this course, I expected to lean a bit of web development and a little about how that directly affects people. In reality, I learn a lot more about PHP and SQL as well the presumptions and pitfalls that plaque today’s tech industry and the world beyond. The book Algorithms of Oppression was especially an important aspect of my learning this semester – applying many of the concepts we learnt in this course. The lectures and reading were organized and the quizzes helped me check my progress every week – allowing me to see if I needed to relearn or look at a concept I might have missed. Overall, I found this course interesting, informative, and really well managed (even after being totally online!)

            This semester has been significantly different than the previous ones, as the majority of the classes have been remotely administered online because of the global pandemic. 
The first pair assignment in the course was great to develop teamwork and coordination skills. It was great to work remotely with a teammate, as online classes this semester meant that there was minimal interaction with peers in our classes. Working in pairs for the assignments was helpful as we could take help from each other whenever we got stuck on a particular part of the assignment. I hence got to learn a lot from my partner, Nirmit, and was able to help him with some parts of html and css coding. The second assignment helped me get to know my partner better, and gave me an opportunity to learn the basics of building and hosting a website on a remote server. Although making a website from scratch seemed challenging at first, I became more comfortable with coding in html as the semester progressed by.</p>
 
<p>The final project expanded the pair programming experience to working with a group of four people. Me and my partner from the initial assignments, Nirmit, were grouped to work with two graduate students, Ashley and Yutong for our final project. By working together in a team of four, I learned how to better chalk out a plan with team mates such that each member can make effective contributions to the group. I enjoyed working on the final project, wherein we created an alternative to the harvard implicit racial bias test. Our group tried our best to come up with interesting questions for the survey and coming up with creative ways of displaying the results and analysis of the survey on completion. For the project, I worked on building various pages of our website, changing and improving with iterations of feedback that we received. I also led in designing the survey questions page, formulating queries for the answers we received and analysing the results.</p>

<p>Finally, this course was structured very well. Being relatively new to html and css coding, the first few weeks helped me recall coding basics and helped build a strong foundation for website development. The assignment on sharing our favorite tech heroes helped me learn a lot about women and people of color who have made great contributions to the development of the tech industry. The part of class I found the most interesting was the weekly group-wise discussion. The discussion forum gave us an opportunity to not only highlight important weekly takeaways but also provided us with the ability to ask important questions as discussion leaders, and answer questions asked by other peers. The concepts of Hegemony and Meritocracy highlighted how different types of bias prevails in the current day tech industry. It was fascinating to learn how popular search engines like google have played a major role in creating and promoting racial stereotypes in people, a process explained with great detail by author Safiya Noble in her work ‘Algorithms of Oppression.’ The readings each week provided insightful information on the accompanying topics, and evoked interest in learning more about the topics. Links to online articles on different tags used in html, css and php coding answered a lot of questions regarding the syntax of various functions. It was great fun learning to code in php, and building elements that were not just static but changed dynamically on the website. I had always wondered where all of the anonymous feedback that we often provide to companies after using online services like amazon gets stored and processed. The tutorial on creating database tables and incorporating them to create feedback forms was an important skill that I developed in this course. Taking the harvard implicit bias test for a couple of weeks before starting to build our own website was a productive practice. The only thing, if any that I found would have helped me learn better in this course were more synchronous lectures and discussions. Overall, the course was very effective in propagating the idea of how and why is bias present in the tech industry as a whole and what we can do to prevent it. I would like to thank Professor Reginold Royston and Bryan Knowles for a wonderful semester!
